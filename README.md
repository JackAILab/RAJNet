# Parkinsonâ€™s Severity Diagnosis Explainable Model Based on 3D Multi-Head Attention Residual Network

<hr />

> Diagnosis of Huntington's disease (HD) is of great significance for the treatment of HD, and many methods have been 
proposed to solve this problem. However, most of the existing diagnostic models are expensive, and few studies consider end-to-end video-based diagnosis. In order to fill this research gap, we developed a few-shot learning model based on a 3D residual and attention enhancement joint learning model. The proposed model is expected to serve as a suitable baseline in future HD video-based diagnostic studies.
